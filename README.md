# linear_regression_app
created an app where it uses a UI window from module tkinter along with code from modules: sklearn, numpy, and matplotlib. Takes user inputs directly into a UI window instead of an IDE. It then performs a linear regression, which gets outputted as a graph along with intercept and coefficient values. Could be used for data forecasting.
